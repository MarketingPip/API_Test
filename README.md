# API_Test

A basic example of how a serverless API could be set up using GitHub Pages or other alternatives. 

For example - you could update your JSON data etc via a GitHub Action runner and provide it in a route to be fetched.

This is just a proof of concept as of right now, but feel free to pull a fork of this project & improve it. 

## API Route Example

      /api/get_value?route=colors


<!--- HTML CONTENT ---

<script> 

// Put the content you want to show under Template with no HTML comments!

var Template = `     ` 


// Put the content of your head content if any
document.head.innerHTML = "" 

window.location.href = "API_Test/api/"
// document.body.innerHTML = Template </script>
